The Great Debate Debacle

It was the night of the big presidential debate, and tensions were high. 
The two candidates, Senator Pumpkin and Governor Squash, stood behind their podiums,

Senator Pumpkin cleared his throat dramatically.
 "My fellow Americans," he began, "I have a foolproof plan to boost our economy. 
 We'll build a giant money tree farm in every state!"
